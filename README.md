# Trip's Profile
Hello, I'm a Saudi Arabian college student. I code as a hobby, and usually use C#, although I'm thinking of trying out C(++) *eventually*. for now however, You can find out more about me [on my personal website!](https://trps.dev)

I don't code very often, and usually focus on college or life, but I'm still alive! (statistically)
