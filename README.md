# Trip's Profile
Hello, I'm a Saudi Arabian guy who codes as a hobby, and usually write in Python, or C# (and HTML/CSS if you count those), although I'm thinking of trying out Rust *eventually,* for now however, You can find out more about me [on my personal website!](https://trps.dev)


If you're wondering why I seem to work on a lot of private repos, it's because I only release my repos publicly if they reach the functional stage or if I need to share the code with others, so a lot of that private Github activity is working on said WIPs.

# Current Projects
Currently, I'm working on these projects, in order of priority:
1. BitTransfer \[C#\] - A user-friendly app using AvaloniaUI, with a custom protocol under the hood designed to load-balance large transfers over separate connections simultaneously. - Early stages 

2. [Asybot](https://github.com/Trip7274/AsyBot) \[Python\] - A simple Discord bot built to try to make an LLM act like a regular, normal person in a Discord server. - Very early stages

3. BitTransfer \[Python\] - The Python implementation of BitTransfer, shifted into being a CLI instead of a GUI, and mainly used as an API to interact with other Python implementations, and end-user implementations in C#

4. [Trips-Home](https://github.com/Trip7274/Trips-Home) \[HTML\] - My own personal website! written in pure HTML/CSS/JS, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. - Mostly done, just maintaining it
