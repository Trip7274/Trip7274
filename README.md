# Trip's Profile
Hello, I'm a Saudi Arabian guy who codes as a hobby, and usually writes in C#, or Python (or HTML/CSS if you count those), although I'm thinking of trying out Rust *eventually,* for now however, You can find out more about me [on my personal website!](https://trps.dev)


If you're wondering why most of my work seems to be in private repos, it's because I only release my repos publicly if they reach the functional stage or if I need to share the code with others, so a lot of that private Github activity is working on said WIPs. (I also don't commit often, and I should fix that)

# Current Projects
Currently, I'm working on these projects, in order of priority:
1. BitTransfer \[C#\] - A user-friendly app (GUI/CLI), with a custom protocol under the hood designed to load-balance large transfers over separate connections simultaneously. - Early stages 

2. [Trips-Home](https://github.com/Trip7274/Trips-Home) \[HTML\] - My own personal website! written in pure HTML/CSS/JS, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. - Maintenance

# Planned projects
Here are some projects I'm planning on working on after BitTransfer, this will change often and is in no particular order.
1. Discord custom profile CSS plugin
