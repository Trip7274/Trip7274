# Trip's Profile
Hello, I'm a Saudi Arabian guy who codes as a hobby, and usually writes in Python, or C# (and HTML/CSS if you count those), although I'm thinking of trying out Rust *eventually,* for now however, You can find out more about me [on my personal website!](https://trps.dev)


If you're wondering why most of my work seems to be in private repos, it's because I only release my repos publicly if they reach the functional stage or if I need to share the code with others, so a lot of that private Github activity is working on said WIPs. (I also don't commit often, and I should fix that)

# Current Projects
Currently, I'm working on these projects, in order of priority:
1. BitTransfer \[C#\] - A user-friendly app (GUI/CLI), with a custom protocol under the hood designed to load-balance large transfers over separate connections simultaneously. - Early stages 

2. BitTransfer \[Python\] - The Python implementation of BitTransfer, shifted into being a CLI instead of a GUI, and mainly used as an API to interact with other Python implementations, and end-user implementations in C# - In the future

3. [Trips-Home](https://github.com/Trip7274/Trips-Home) \[HTML\] - My own personal website! written in pure HTML/CSS/JS, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. - Refactoring

# Planned projects
Here are some projects I'm planning on working on after BitTransfer, this will change often and is in no particular order.
1. Discord custom profile CSS plugin
2. Phone/PC audio, clipboard, camera, notification, and playback hand-off and sync
